### CS6375 Assignment1
due to file size limitations I cannot provide the 'word_embedding.pkl'; however, the train/val/test files are provided in the repo. please see the requirements.txt for versions. In addition to the provided libraries, we also use matplotlib to generate our train loss + val accuracy plots and torch with CUDA to speed up our network. An example script to run the python file can be found here: python ffnn.py --hidden_dim 64 --epochs 100 --train_data training.json --val_data validation.json
